# fertilizer_recommendation

A tool that can detect nine nutrient deficiencies across three major crops in India and recommends fertilizer type and amount for farmers upon taking their additional input like age of the pant and not so seen symptoms

#### CROPS FOCUSSED:

- Rice
- Wheat
- Maize

#### NUTRIENTS FOCUSSED:

- Potassium
- Magnesium
- Zinc
- Iron
- Manganese
- Copper
- Boron
- Sulphur
- Nitrogen deficiency levels - only for rice

### FLOW:

- User can upload an image of the leaf (that begins to show some symptoms like loss of color(chlorosis), drying(necrosis)
- The model runs on the image and classifies it into 1 of 5 symptoms (includes a healthy/normal class).
- Uses user input on age of leaf (new/old/middle) and presence of 4 additional symptoms (not capture in leaf image), like stunted growth of entire plant.
- Using this infomation and the research on identifying nutrient deficiencies (done by Montana State University, U.S. Department of Agriculture), the following rules are developed.
- These results are further used to recommend appropriate fertilizers to the farmer, helping in **avoiding overfertilization** by adding standard fertilizers recommended to crop grown and **control costs**

### RESULTS

- Validation accuracy: 90%
- FInal Test accuracy: 88.24%

- The project_report file contains a detailed description of the features of the project

### FILES:

- fertilizer.xls - Excel file containing the data on fertilizers. It has 2 pages which needs to be updated with the info collected
- first_app.py - The web application that is viewed by users
- 200_epoch_97_87_soft.h5 - Neural network model for classifying leaf image into 1 of 5 classes ['interveinal', 'margin', 'normal', 'spotty', 'tip']
- plain2model.tflite - Neural network model for classifying rice leaf image into 1 of 4 classes based on LCC
- nn_model_basic.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing code used to train the Neural Network model
- SessionState.py - Library to allow use of session in application
